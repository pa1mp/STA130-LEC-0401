    "## Analysis 1: Social Support and Mental Well-being\n",
    "\n",
    "**Research question**: How does social support, in terms of close friendships and family support, influence mental well-being and self-rated happiness?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variables:\n",
    "- **CONNECTION_social_num_close_friends_grouped**: Measures the number of close friends, relevant as close friendships are crucial for emotional support and well-being.\n",
    "    - **Visualization**: Histogram showing the distribution of close friend counts. This is appropriate as it reveals patterns in the number of close friends, such as whether most people report high, medium, or low counts, and helps identify the distribution's shape.\n",
    "- **PSYCH_zimet_multidimensional_social_support_scale_family_helps** AND **PSYCH_zimet_multidimensional_social_support_scale_friends**: Indicate the support received from family and friends during difficult times.\n",
    "    - **Visualization**: Bar chart comparing average family and friend support levels. This is suitable for illustrating differences between sources of support, making it easy to compare means across categories.\n",
    "- **WELLNESS_self_rated_mental_health** AND **WELLNESS_subjective_happiness_scale_happy**: Self-rated mental health and happiness, both indicators of overall well-being.\n",
    "    - **Visualization**: Box plots for happiness and mental health ratings across different levels of support. These are appropriate as they display the distribution, variability, and potential outliers for well-being measures in relation to social support levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Chosen Method and Analysis Procedure:\n",
    "- **Simple Linear Regression**: We will model subjective happiness or mental health as outcomes, using the number of close friends and family/friend support scores as predictors.\n",
    "    - Use the regression model to examine the relationship between each source of social support and mental health or happiness.\n",
    "    - Each support variable will serve as an independent variable, while happiness or mental health will be the dependent variable.\n",
    "- **Assumptions**: This analysis assumes a linear relationship between social support and well-being. We also assume that the residuals are normally distributed and that the observations are independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothesis and Expected Results:\n",
    "- **Hypothesis**: Individuals with a higher number of close friends and stronger family/friend support are expected to report higher happiness and better mental health.\n",
    "- **Relevance**: This analysis emphasizes the impact of social support on well-being, aligning with the project’s goal of demonstrating the importance of social connections. Findings could inform policies aimed at fostering family and friend support networks to improve mental health outcomes.\n",

    "## Analysis 2: Impact of Community Cohesion on Loneliness and Isolation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Research question**: How does neighborhood cohesion affect feelings of loneliness and isolation?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variables:\n",
    "- **GEO_robinson_neighbourhood_cohesion_scale_sense_of_community**: Measures the general sense of community, which is expected to be inversely related to loneliness.\n",
    "    - **Visualization**: Bar plot showing the average sense of community scores across different loneliness levels. Bar plots are suitable for comparing average scores between groups, providing a clear view of how community sense relates to loneliness.\n",
    "- **GEO_robinson_neighbourhood_cohesion_scale_friends** AND **GEO_robinson_neighbourhood_cohesion_scale_emergency**: Represent perceptions of neighborhood friendships and willingness to help in emergencies.\n",
    "    - **Visualization**: Bar plot comparing average loneliness scores for people reporting high vs. low community cohesion indicators. Bar plots effectively show differences in mean loneliness scores across these community support indicators.\n",
    "- **LONELY_ucla_loneliness_scale_isolated** AND **LONELY_ucla_loneliness_scale_companionship**: Indicators of perceived isolation and companionship, reflecting loneliness.\n",
    "    - **Visualization**: Histogram of loneliness scores. Histograms are appropriate for showing the distribution of loneliness scores, helping identify common levels and the shape of the distribution across different community settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Chosen Method and Analysis Procedure:\n",
    "- **Confidence Intervals**: Construct confidence intervals for the average loneliness scores of groups with high vs. low neighborhood cohesion.\n",
    "    - Calculate the mean loneliness scores for each group (high and low neighborhood cohesion).\n",
    "    - Construct confidence intervals for each group to understand the typical range of loneliness levels.\n",
    "- **Assumptions**: This analysis assumes a normal distribution of loneliness scores within each group.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothesis and Expected Results:\n",
    "- **Hypothesis**: Higher neighborhood cohesion is associated with lower loneliness and isolation, as reflected in narrower and lower confidence intervals for groups with high cohesion.\n",
    "- **Relevance**: Demonstrating that neighborhood cohesion can alleviate loneliness supports the project’s goal of fostering strong community ties to improve well-being. Results may encourage community programs that strengthen neighborly bonds in areas with high isolation.\n",

    "## Analysis 3: Digital Interaction and Social Well-being\n",
    "\n",
    "**Research Question**: Does time spent on social media and frequency of virtual interactions correlate with loneliness and satisfaction with social engagement?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variables and Exploration:\n",
    "- **CONNECTION_social_media_time_per_day**: Measures daily social media use, relevant for examining digital vs. in-person social interaction effects.\n",
    "    - **Visualization**: Histogram showing the distribution of social media time usage. This visualization helps identify common usage levels and the distribution of social media time, highlighting any potential skew or outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **CONNECTION_activities_video_chat_p3m**: Frequency of video chats, providing insight into reliance on virtual connections.\n",
    "    - **Visualization**: Bar plot comparing average loneliness scores for high vs. low video chat users. Bar plots are suitable for comparing the mean loneliness levels between different groups, making it easy to see potential differences.\n",
    "- **LONELY_ucla_loneliness_scale_left_out** AND **LONELY_ucla_loneliness_scale_isolated**: Reflect feelings of being left out and isolation.\n",
    "    - **Visualization**: Violin plot showing the distribution of loneliness scores across social media usage levels. Violin plots are ideal for illustrating the density and spread of scores, providing a detailed view of how loneliness varies across social media usage groups.\n",
    "- **CONNECTION_time_with_others_satisfied**: Measures satisfaction with time spent socializing.\n",
    "    - **Visualization**: Box plot showing satisfaction levels across different social media usage groups. Box plots are effective for displaying the median, spread, and variability of satisfaction levels, allowing for a straightforward comparison between groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Chosen Method and Analysis Procedure:\n",
    "- **Hypothesis Testing**: Perform a hypothesis test to assess whether there is a significant association between social media/video chat usage and loneliness or satisfaction with social engagement, using p-values to determine significance.\n",
    "    - Define null and alternative hypotheses (e.g., \"There is no significant association between social media usage and loneliness\" vs. \"There is a significant association\").\n",
    "    - Calculate the p-value to determine the significance of the observed association between social media usage and loneliness.\n",
    "- **Assumptions**: This analysis assumes that the observed relationships between social media use and loneliness are representative of the broader population.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothesis and Expected Results:\n",
    "- **Hypothesis**: Higher social media usage may correlate with increased loneliness, while frequent video chat use may positively influence satisfaction with social interactions.\n",
    "- **Relevance**: This analysis clarifies how digital interactions impact social well-being, providing insight into the balance between online and in-person connections. The findings could guide strategies for using digital tools to combat loneliness effectively.\n"
